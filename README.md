This project 95% emulates the game of tetris. It is because it has the following issues that may or may not be fixed in the future:

-If a line isn't formed at the bottom, it doesn't count. 
-There is a glitch where sometimes parts of blocks go out of playable area.

If you inspect my code, you will see a lot of code blocks. I feel there is no way around this. At least it works. I had a lot of fun making this!
