DISCLAIMER:
This was coded primarily with a Lenovo ThinkPad T590 which has an integrated GPU in the Core i7. When I recently built my own computer with an Nvidia RTX 3050 (I am fairly new at this building PC business so I didn't realize it wasn't the best GPU for the money back when GPUs were scarce and were filthy expensive, but at least it runs Overwatch with 130 fps but not sure yet how many frames I'll get when I'll eventually stream on Twitch. Sorry for the ramble :P), I realized how fast everything is just due to the fps difference. Just please keep this in mind if this happens with you.

This project was inspired by the original Tetris game. It is almost like the original, but it has the following issues that will be fixed in the future:

1) If a line isn't formed at the bottom, it doesn't count. 
2) There is a glitch where sometimes parts of blocks go out of playable area. 

If you inspect my code, you will see a lot of code blocks. I had the goal of finishing this within a few weeks, so I brute forced my way through not worrying much about efficiency. So, I am aware there is another path I can take for a future version to rebuild the core code which eliminates these blocks and might also solve the issues stated above. 

I had a lot of fun making this!
